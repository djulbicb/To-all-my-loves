Docker and K8s makes developing and deployment much easier. Its a container technology, for creating and managing containers.
> **Container** is standardized unit of software. Package of code and dependencies to run it.

Linux natively supports Docker engine. Windows and Mac may need Docker Toolbox or Docker Windows.

### commands
```
npm init
npm install
npm install express
node app.mjs

docker build .
docker run -p hostPort:containerPort <image hash>
docker stop <container hash> 
```
### app.js
```
import express from 'express'
import connectToDatabase from './helpers.mjs'
const app = express()
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send('<h2>Hi there!</h2>');
});

await connectToDatabase()
app.listen(3000)
```

### helpers.mjs
```
const connectToDatabase = () => {
  const dummyPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Resolving promise...")
        resolve();
    }, 1000);
  });

  return dummyPromise;
};

export default connectToDatabase;
```

#### Dockerfile
```
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install 
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "app.mjs"]
```
- **FROM node** - must be first command. Sets base image for subsequant commands
- **WORKDIR /app** - Set the working directory for any subsequent ADD, COPY, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, or RUN instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
- **COPY /path1 /path2**- Copy files or folders from source to the dest path in the image's filesystem. Path2 if relative, is relative to working dir
- **RUN npm install** - Execute any commands on top of the current image as a new layer and commit the results. If you execute this without WORKDIR its gonna execute in root folder
- **EXPOSE 30 80 3000**, **7000-8000** - Define the network ports that this container will listen on at runtime.
- **CMD ["node", "app.mjs"]** - Default for container. Only one CMD per Dockerfile. If missing than entrypoint has to be specified
