1. Think about the problem. Breakdown the problem. Make a todo list
2. Start with easiest
    - Make a list of dice emojis
    - Generate random number
    - Compare dice value against previous
3. Take one problem and convert it into comments
    # import modules

    # use randint to generate a radnom integer

    # compare values
